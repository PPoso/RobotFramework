# Reactiontime Test. Used to check how fast a robot can react.

# This test case automates a reaction time test on the Human Benchmark website. The robot accepts the cookie consent, starts the reaction time game, clicks on the screen when it turns green, and then stops the game. Finally, it captures a screenshot of the results to verify the completion of the test.

# The purpose of this test is to ensure that the reaction time test can be successfully completed by a bot, and it captures the result for further analysis.
